    "In 2020, over 3.26 million Medicare beneficiaries depend on one or more forms of insulin to manage their medical conditions. The aggregated out-of-pocket cost for insulin alone was \\\\$1.03 billion. A Medicare beneficiary spends \\\\$572 out of pocket to cover the cost of insulin annually . Insulin is a life-saving medication and a critical component to medical management for many people. Cost burden increases the gap in insulin access which poses a significant risk on medical complications from unmanaged diabetes, such as amputation or heart attack . Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) recognized the severe consequences from insulin inaccessibility. CMS implemented the Part D Senior Savings Model (SSM) on January 1, 2021. SSM offers supplementary insulin coverage which caps the out-of-pocket expense for insulin at \\$35 per one-month supply during the deductible, initial coverage, and coverage gap phase. SSM aims to close the insulin access gap and improve medication adherence."

However, due to the size of the datasets and the limited computational capability, I only include examples from 2010 to better understand the structure of the data."

This may be due to the small size sample and the fact that the differences are very small. However, we should keep in mind that medication consumption may not follow the classical demand-price relationship because consumption of medication, at a certain point, depends on the medical need of an individual. Therefore, changes in price may not necessarily result in drastic change in insulin consumption. Nonetheless, the predicted increase provide a valuable insight into the effectiveness of price cap on necessary medication such as insulin."

    "The objective of this project is to use a variety of machine learning algorithms to predict the change in average 30-day insulin consumption among Medicare beneficiaries, if SSM is implemented. I utilized parametric approaches including LASSO regression, Ridge regression, Elastic Net, and PCA. I also utilized non-parametric approach, Random Forest. I performed the analyses on data set that is scaled differently. This is because the scales of each variables are drastically different. I suspected that the difference in the scales may cause the prediction performance to be extremely poor so scaling using different scalers can address the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "I found that parametric approaches performed very poorly in predicting insulin demand out of sample. The table below compares the performance of LASSO and Ridge regression in terms of their R-sqaure values. Across all scaling techniques, LASSO and Ridge regression performed extremely poor with R-sqaure values as low as 0.011, meaning that the model can only explain 1% of the varibility in the average 30-day consumption. Furthermore, PCA performed poorly as well, despite my attempt to tune the hyperparameter and L1 ratio. The MAE from Elastic Net was as high as 8.92 in Min Max scaled data, and 7.27 and 7.39 for unscaled and standard scaled data, respectively. Given that the mean average 30-day consumption is approximately 14 among this set of samples, MAE value as high as 8.92 suggests that Elastic Net is also a poor-performing predictor. Another approach I attempted was PCA which had the R-square value of -0.001, suggesting an extrememly poor predictability. The extrememly poor performances across scaling techniques for these parametric approaches suggests that the relationship between consumption and predictors may not be linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "A non-parametric approach confirms that the relationship between the average 30-day consumption and other included predictors is not linear. Random Forest can predict the change in consumption with accuracy as high as 77% in the standardized data, and 52.9% and 56.5% in unscaled and Min Max scaled data, respectively. Although this is not an impressive accuracy rate, it is much better than the parametric approaches. Using Random Forest, I found that SSM can increases the average consumption by 0.61 unit per 30-day. However, the t-test suggests that the difference is not statistically significant which may stem from small sample size. Nonetheless, this finding provide a valuable insight into the impact of price on necessity consumption such as insulin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future study should further explore other non-parametric algorithm to improve the accuracy of the prediction. Algorithm such as Neural Network can potentially improve predictability significantly due to its complex and delicate network. I could not perform Neural Network due to technical issue. In addition, future study should tune hyperparameters in the non-parametric model to improve predictability."
