    "In 2020, over 3.26 million Medicare beneficiaries depend on one or more forms of insulin to manage their medical conditions. The aggregated out-of-pocket cost for insulin alone was \\\\$1.03 billion. A Medicare beneficiary spends \\\\$572 out of pocket to cover the cost of insulin annually . Insulin is a life-saving medication and a critical component to medical management for many people. Cost burden increases the gap in insulin access which poses a significant risk on medical complications from unmanaged diabetes, such as amputation or heart attack . Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) recognized the severe consequences from insulin inaccessibility. CMS implemented the Part D Senior Savings Model (SSM) on January 1, 2021. SSM offers supplementary insulin coverage which caps the out-of-pocket expense for insulin at \\$35 per one-month supply during the deductible, initial coverage, and coverage gap phase. SSM aims to close the insulin access gap and improve medication adherence."

    "The final dataset I use for analysis consists of 10 years of microdata, from 2010-2019, about insulin consumption and expenditure, and comorbid conditions. There are 9,004 observations in this dataset, each observation is a sampled individual. It is important to note that this is a cross-sectional dataset where each observation in different survey year is not the same individual. The samples included in this analysis are limited to those who filled at least one insulin prescription during a given survey year.\n",

All of the dataset are from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). The following section display examples of each dataset from the year 2010. The datasets are the same format across all the included survey years. However, due to the size of the datasets and the limited computational capability, I only include examples from 2010 to better understand the structure of the data."
